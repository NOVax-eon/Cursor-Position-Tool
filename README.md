# Cursor-Position-Tool
A tool to locate the real-time position of the cursor
Introduction to Python Cursor Position Real - Time Locator Tool​
In daily computer operations, development debugging, and design work, quickly knowing the precise position of the mouse cursor can often improve efficiency. To meet this need, we have developed this Python - based cursor position real - time locator tool, which has many practical features and brings convenience to users.​
Real - Time Position Display​
The core function of this tool is to display the position of the cursor in real - time and accurately. By calling the system API, the program continuously tracks the movement of the mouse and immediately feeds back the latest coordinate information in the display window. Whether it is debugging the positioning of UI interface elements during development, or designers need to accurately layout graphics during creation, or ordinary users need coordinate information in certain specific scenarios, this tool can ensure that the obtained cursor position information is always the latest and most accurate.​
Concise and Elegant Interface Design​
The interface of the tool follows the design concept of simplicity and compactness. The overall interface has no redundant elements and presents the cursor coordinate data in the most intuitive way. The window size has been carefully considered. It neither takes up too much screen space to affect normal operations nor can it clearly display key information. Each time the tool is launched, the window will automatically open in the upper - right corner of the computer screen, without interfering with the main tasks that the user is performing, and it is at the edge of the field of vision, which is convenient to view at any time.​
Flexible and Convenient Operation Experience​
The window supports free dragging. Users only need to gently move the interface to place it in the most convenient position on the screen, which is free and flexible. The tool has an extremely fast response speed. From the movement of the mouse to the update and display of the coordinate information, there is almost no delay, bringing users a smooth and efficient user experience. Whether it is a scenario where the mouse is moved frequently or an emergency where coordinates need to be obtained quickly, this tool can respond quickly to meet the user's requirements for convenience and speed.​


Python 光标位置实时定位工具简介​
在日常电脑操作、开发调试及设计工作中，快速知晓鼠标光标的精确位置常能提升效率。为满足这一需求，我们开发了这款基于 Python 的光标位置实时定位工具，它拥有诸多实用特性，为用户带来便利。​
实时位置呈现​
该工具最核心的功能，便是实时、精准地展示光标所处位置。通过调用系统 API，程序持续追踪鼠标移动，将最新的坐标信息即时反馈在显示窗口中。无论是开发时调试 UI 界面元素的定位，还是设计师在创作时需要精确布局图形，亦或是普通用户在某些特定场景下对坐标信息的需求，此工具都能确保获取到的光标位置信息始终是最新、最准确的。​
简洁优雅的界面设计​
工具界面遵循简洁小巧的设计理念。整体界面无冗余元素，以最直观的方式呈现光标坐标数据。窗口尺寸经过精心考量，既不会占据过多屏幕空间影响正常操作，又能清晰展示关键信息。每次启动工具，窗口会自动在电脑屏幕右上角打开，不干扰用户正在进行的主要任务，且处于视野边缘，方便随时查看。​
灵活便捷的操作体验​
窗口支持随意拖拽，用户只需轻轻挪动界面，就能将其放置在屏幕上最便于查看的位置，自由灵活。工具响应速度极快，从鼠标移动到坐标信息更新显示，几乎无延迟，为用户带来流畅、高效的使用感受。无论是频繁移动鼠标的操作场景，还是需要快速获取坐标的紧急时刻，该工具都能迅速给出响应，满足用户对方便快捷的要求。​
